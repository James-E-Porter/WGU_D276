                <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

                <p>I am writing to express my interest in a position related to Information Systems Security. With over <em>eight years of experience</em> in managing network and system security within Department of Defense frameworks, I have cultivated a robust background in risk management, auditing, and implementation of security controls.</p>

                <p>At <strong>UICGS / Bowhead</strong> and <strong>ALAKA'INA FOUNDATION</strong>, I was responsible for tailoring RMF packages, conducting FISMA reporting, and ensuring adherence to DISA directives and NIST 800-53 controls. My role required constant adaptation to evolving security standards and collaboration across multidisciplinary teams to secure mission-critical systems.</p>

                <p><mark>I am particularly proud</mark> of my ability to translate complex regulatory requirements into clear, actionable procedures that ensure compliance and reduce risk for stakeholders.</p>

                <p>I appreciate your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with your organization’s goals.</p>

                <p>Sincerely,<br>
                James Porter</p>
